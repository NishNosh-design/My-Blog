        <p>I watched it in 2019 and it was amazing. It was a really nice and creative movie and very sentimental due to
          Tony Stark's death. I didn't know what to expect after Avengers: Infinity War but then I was really surprised at
          how good the movie was when I saw it. There were a lot of shocking moments and unexpected things. But,
          overall it was a fantastic movie. I gave it four stars instead of five because they could have killed another character 
          instead of Ironman because he was my favourite character. :(

        <p>It was a really well animated film because the graphics were very realistic and high definition.The lore 
           was really well written but I could easily guess it. It will be prefect for kids below
           the age of five, so if you have any young siblings, you should show them this movie because 
           this movie is perfect for that age category. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because
           I already saw the cartoon version in 2015 which was 7 years ago so I already knew
           what was going to happen.
